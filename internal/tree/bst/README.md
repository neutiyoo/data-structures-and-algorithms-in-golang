# Binary Search Trees

## Operations

| Name   | Time Complexity (best case) | Time Complexity (worst case) |
| ------ | :-------------------------: | :--------------------------: |
| INSERT |         `O(log n)`          |         `O(height)`          |
| DELETE |         `O(log n)`          |         `O(height)`          |
| SEARCH |         `O(log n)`          |         `O(height)`          |
| MIN    |         `O(log n)`          |         `O(height)`          |
| MAX    |         `O(log n)`          |         `O(height)`          |

## Self-Balancing Binary Search Trees

Ensure that height always is O(log n)

- Red-Black Tree
- AVL Tree
